"""
Performance Tests Package

Contains performance and stress tests for the Property Investment Calculator
to ensure the system can handle large portfolios and complex scenarios efficiently.

Test Files:
- test_simulation_speed.py: Performance tests for simulation execution time
- test_memory_usage.py: Memory usage tests for large portfolio simulations
- test_scalability.py: Tests for system behavior with increasing data size

Performance tests focus on:
- Execution time benchmarks
- Memory usage profiling
- Scalability with large datasets
- Resource consumption monitoring
- Stress testing with extreme scenarios

These tests help ensure the system remains performant as complexity grows.
