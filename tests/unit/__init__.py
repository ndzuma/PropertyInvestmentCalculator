Unit Tests Package

Contains pure unit tests for individual components of the Property Investment Calculator.

Test Files:
- test_dataclasses.py: Tests for PropertyInvestment, costs, and parameter classes
- test_calculations.py: Tests for financial calculations (PMT, cash flow, etc.)
- test_strategies.py: Tests for strategy creation and configuration logic
- test_simulation.py: Tests for portfolio simulator core functionality
- test_yields.py: Tests for property and portfolio yield calculations

Each test file should focus on testing a single component in isolation,
using mocks/stubs for dependencies where necessary.
